    <h3>Forehand</h3>
    <p>
      The forehand is usually the first tennis stroke everyone learns. It is a
      full swing with your dominant hand. Traditionally people are most
      confident with this stroke and tend to generate more power and control
      when executing this stroke. This is the bread and butter of my personally
      tennis game.

    <h3>Backhand</h3>
    <p>
      The backhand stroke is swinging the racket from your non dominant side.
      There are two variations of the backhand. Commonly people use either a
      two-handed backhand or a one-handed backhand. With the one-handed backhand
      it is similar to the forehand in the sense that you still are using your
      dominant hand expect on the other side of your body. From personal
      experience I use the two-handed backhand in order to have more control.
      Everyone is different, it truly depends on the way you start learning. Fun
      Fact: Roger Federer uses a one-hand.

    <h3>Serve</h3>
    <p>
      The serve is a cruical part of tennis. It is viewed that whoever is
      serving has the upper hand in that game. There are three kinds of serves.
      The flat serve, slice serve, and kick serve. Personally I think a Flat
      serve has the most power, the slice serve is my safe bet, and the kick
      serve is very difficult but is very useful and a BIG FLEX if done
      properly.
